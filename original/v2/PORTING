Changes that were made when porting from Franz Lisp to Common Lisp
------------------------------------------------------------------

Refactor if statement to remove else and elseif, using progn when appropriate
Refactor do loop with new syntax (extra parentheses)

Rename variables named 'T' to something else (eg. 'S')
Rename Class, Or, And, Not, EQ, Apply, Delete, List, Array to gClass, gOr, gAnd, gNot, gEQ, gApply, gDelete, gList, gArray
Rename Type to ExpressionType
Rename Substitute to SubstituteVar

Put # before an anonymous function

Replace assq with assoc
Replace caseq with case
Replace memq with member
Replace remq with remove
Replace delq with delete
Replace patom with princ

Replace readlist and exploden
An interned gensym can be generated using gentemp
Change argument of gensym to take string instead of symbol

Redefine add, diff, etc. with +, -, etc. Do NOT replace add, diff, minus, times, etc. with CL counterparts, because pattern matcher uses these symbols.
