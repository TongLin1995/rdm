Installation Procedure
----------------------

If your machine is not a SUN-3 running Unix version 4.2SUN, then
you will have to recompile the system.  This is accomplished by
first typing

	make clean

and then

	make

Two other changes are also likely to be necessary before issuing the
above make commands.  Most of the source for the two compilers is
written in LISP.  The two files

	LDMRun
	CDBRun

are used as standard input when the lisp system is invoked.  Both
files contain absolute file names, which means that if you have
installed the system in a directory different from

	/u2/gweddell/research/dbtool/version1.1

then both files must be edited to update the directory names.  Two
other files also contain the absolute files names for LDMRun and
CDBRun themselves

	LDMCompControl.c
	CDBCompControl.c

See the start of each of the four files for further comments.

This version of the RDM tool set uses the following.

	yacc
	lex
	a C compiler
	the C "beautifier" program cb
	the Franz lisp interpretor
	the "liszt" Franz lisp compiler
